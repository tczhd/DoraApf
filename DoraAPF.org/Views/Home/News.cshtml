                Dear John Horgan,<br /><br />

                I am Jason Guo, a Grade 10 student at St. George’s School. In April, my first dog, Dora, was shipped from Dalian, China, to Vancouver,<br />

                Canada, via Hong Kong and Tokyo. During the 5-day convoluted shipment (which was considered the most economically efficient way to the carriers),<br />

                she was constrained in the extremely cold hold of the flights like ordinary lifeless commercial cargo; she had no water to drink and no food to eat <br />

                and died after a night at a veterinarian hospital in Vancouver. Dora’s abnormal death led me to set up a foundation with the help of my family <br />

                and friends to protect small animals, whose lives are very vulnerable, especially when they are neglected or abused. <br />

                We named it the Dora Animal Protection Foundation in memory of the dog whose dismal death would have been avoided if we, humans, had cared.<br />

                Our mission is to provide animals safe and humane living conditions, prevent them from being neglected or abused,  <br />

                and provide support when they need help. As a part of our mission, we implore you to legislate for the protection of small animals <br />

                from being neglected or abused. Specifically, we strongly propose legislation against shipping small animals in the hold of fights <br />

                that arrive at and depart from Canadian airports. Small animals deserve to be respected inhabitants of our civilized world. <br />

                Thank you for your kind consideration of our legislative proposal. If you need further information from us, please let us know.<br /><br />

                Yours truly,<br /><br />

                Jason Guo<br />

                Dear ANA:
                <br /> <br />
                My name is Jason. I am a high school student from Vancouver, Canada. <br />
                On April 16th, 2019, my first dog, Dora (MAWB no. 205-36878391 (YVR)), was <br />
                transported from Dalian, China, to Vancouver, Canada. She was on your flights on April <br />
                19th from Hong Kong to Tokyo (flight: NH860) and on April 20th from Tokyo to <br />
                Vancouver (flight: NH116). When Dora arrived in Vancouver on April 20th around 3:30 <br />
                p.m., she was almost dead due to severe deprivation of food and water and lack of <br />
                oxygen. She died after a night in a veterinarian emergency room. <br />
                In order to memorialize my Dora and prevent such an avoidable tragedy from <br />
                happening again on other small animals, I started the Dora Conservation Animal <br />
                Foundation in Vancouver. I appeal to you to stop transporting small animals in the hold <br />
                of the flight, and my Dora and I need an apology from ANA. <br />
                Your compassion and cooperation would be appreciated, and I look forward to your <br />
                sincere reply. <br /> <br />

                Jason Guo
