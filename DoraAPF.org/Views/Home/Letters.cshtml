                Xiaoyun,

                BC elections should be decided by British Columbians – full stop.

                But legal loopholes let foreign-funded activist groups like Dogwood and Leadnow tip the scales in favour of the NDP.

                These American-funded activists want one thing: to shut down Canada's energy industry.

                And that's why they support the NDP's radical plans to block pipelines, kill energy jobs, and keep gas prices rising.

                So today, I introduced the Control of Foreign Funding and Electoral Influence Act — to get foreign cash out of BC elections.

                I'm always up for a debate with Horgan’s NDP — anywhere, any time — on energy and the environment.

                But when foreign-funded activist groups try to influence how British Columbians vote, we've got a bigger problem.

                It's time to end this practice for good. But the NDP and Greens will do everything they can to stop this bill from becoming law.

                To get foreign money out of BC politics, we need a majority BC Liberal government.

                Sincerely,

                Dear John Horgan,

                I am Jason Guo, a Grade 10 student at St. George’s School. In April, my first dog, Dora, was shipped from Dalian, China, to Vancouver,

                Canada, via Hong Kong and Tokyo. During the 5-day convoluted shipment (which was considered the most economically efficient way to the carriers),

                she was constrained in the extremely cold hold of the flights like ordinary lifeless commercial cargo; she had no water to drink and no food to eat 
               
                and died after a night at a veterinarian hospital in Vancouver. Dora’s abnormal death led me to set up a foundation with the help of my family 
              
                and friends to protect small animals, whose lives are very vulnerable, especially when they are neglected or abused. 
               
                We named it the Dora Animal Protection Foundation in memory of the dog whose dismal death would have been avoided if we, humans, had cared.
                
                Our mission is to provide animals safe and humane living conditions, prevent them from being neglected or abused,  

                and provide support when they need help. As a part of our mission, we implore you to legislate for the protection of small animals 

                from being neglected or abused. Specifically, we strongly propose legislation against shipping small animals in the hold of fights 

                that arrive at and depart from Canadian airports. Small animals deserve to be respected inhabitants of our civilized world. 

                Thank you for your kind consideration of our legislative proposal. If you need further information from us, please let us know.

                Yours truly,

                Jason Guo
