                Dear John Horgan,<br /><br />

                I am Jason Guo, a Grade 10 student at St. George’s School. In April, my first dog, Dora, was shipped from Dalian, China, to Vancouver,<br />

                Canada, via Hong Kong and Tokyo. During the 5-day convoluted shipment (which was considered the most economically efficient way to the carriers),<br />

                she was constrained in the extremely cold hold of the flights like ordinary lifeless commercial cargo; she had no water to drink and no food to eat <br />
               
                and died after a night at a veterinarian hospital in Vancouver. Dora’s abnormal death led me to set up a foundation with the help of my family <br />
              
                and friends to protect small animals, whose lives are very vulnerable, especially when they are neglected or abused. <br />
               
                We named it the Dora Animal Protection Foundation in memory of the dog whose dismal death would have been avoided if we, humans, had cared.<br />
                
                Our mission is to provide animals safe and humane living conditions, prevent them from being neglected or abused,  <br />

                and provide support when they need help. As a part of our mission, we implore you to legislate for the protection of small animals <br />

                from being neglected or abused. Specifically, we strongly propose legislation against shipping small animals in the hold of fights <br />

                that arrive at and depart from Canadian airports. Small animals deserve to be respected inhabitants of our civilized world. <br />

                Thank you for your kind consideration of our legislative proposal. If you need further information from us, please let us know.<br /><br />

                Yours truly,<br /><br />

                Jason Guo<br />

                Dear Mr. Guo:
                <br /> <br />

                Thank you for your email regarding proposed legislation to stop the neglect and abuse of animals. <br />

                We appreciate your taking the time to write and extend our sincere condolences for the loss of your dog, <br />

                Dora. We will share your message with Premier Horgan at our earliest opportunity. <br />

                He will appreciate the chance to hear your personal story and ideas on how to extend protections to small animals. <br />

                On your behalf, we have also provided a copy of your message to the Honourable Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture, <br />

                for her review and consideration. <br />

                Please be assured that your suggestions will be included in any of the Minister’s related discussions going forward. <br />

                If you would like to provide further details on your proposal, <br />

                we encourage you to share them with the Ministry of Agriculture directly at <a href="mailto:AGR.Minister@gov.bc.ca">AGR.Minister@gov.bc.ca</a>. <br />

                We would also recommend getting in contact with your local Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). <br />

                Their office may be able to offer assistance in furthering your advocacy. <br />

                You can find contact information for your MLA at the link listed below: <br /> <br /> <br />
